# Advent of Code 2025 Day 1 - Chat Session

## User
Create folders for 2025 under tests, runner and the AdventOfCode project

## Assistant
Created all three 2025 folders:

- `AdventOfCode.Tests/2025`
- `AdventOfCode/2025`
- `AdventOfCode.Runner/InputData/Year2025` (following the existing `Year20XX` naming convention)

---

## User
Create a stub implementation for AdventOfCode.Year2025.Day1. It should have a single public method called GetResult, take a string[] parameter named inputLines, and return 0. Align with patterns in AdventOfCode.Year2023.Day1

## Assistant
Created `AdventOfCode\2025\Day1.cs` with a stub implementation:

```csharp
namespace AdventOfCode.Year2025;

public static class Day1
{
    public static int GetResult(string[] inputLines) => 0;
}
```

---

## User
Create a test for AdventOfCode.Year2025.Day1 under AdventOfCode.Tests.2025. Align with patterns in AdventOfCode.Year2023.Day1Test.cs

## Assistant
Created `AdventOfCode.Tests\2025\Day1Tests.cs`:

```csharp
namespace AdventOfCode.Year2025.Tests;

public class Day1Tests
{
    [Test]
    public void GetResult_ReturnsExpectedResult()
    {
        string[] inputLines = GetInputLines("");

        var result = Day1.GetResult(inputLines);
        result.Should().Be(0);
    }

    private static string[] GetInputLines(string input) => input.Split(Environment.NewLine);
}
```

Follows the same patterns as Year2023:
- File-scoped namespace with `.Tests` suffix
- NUnit `[Test]` attribute
- FluentAssertions `.Should().Be()`
- Private `GetInputLines` helper method

---

## User
Run AdventOfCode.Year2025.Tests.Day1Tests to make sure it passes.

## Assistant
Test passed successfully:

```
Passed!  - Failed:     0, Passed:     1, Skipped:     0, Total:     1, Duration: 27 ms
```

---

## User
Update the solution to use net10.0

## Assistant
Updated all three projects to `net10.0`:
- `AdventOfCode\AdventOfCode.csproj`
- `AdventOfCode.Tests\AdventOfCode.Tests.csproj`
- `AdventOfCode.Runner\AdventOfCode.Runner.csproj`

Tests pass with the new target framework:
```
Passed!  - Failed:     0, Passed:     1, Skipped:     0, Total:     1, Duration: 18 ms - AdventOfCode.Tests.dll (net10.0)
```

---

## User
Update Program.cs in AdventOfCode.Runner to allow selection and running of the 2025 Day 1 exercise. Give it a name of "TBC" for now.

## Assistant
Updated `Program.cs` with:

1. **Menu item** (line 61):
   ```csharp
   Console.WriteLine("> '25-1' - 2025 Day 1 (TBC)");
   ```

2. **Switch case** (lines 326-331):
   ```csharp
   case "25-1":
       {
           var result = AdventOfCode.Year2025.Day1.GetResult(GetInputDataLines(2025, 1));
           Console.WriteLine($"Result: {result}");
       }
       break;
   ```

Build succeeded with 0 errors.

---

## User
Add test data under AdventOfCodeRunner.InputDay for 2025 day 1. Use 10 short random lines of text as input.

## Assistant
Created `AdventOfCode.Runner\InputData\Year2025\Day1.txt` with 10 lines of test data and registered it as an embedded resource in the .csproj file.

Build succeeded.

---

## User
Run the application and check it returns the expected value of 0 when selecting the exercise for 2025 day 1.

## Assistant
The application ran successfully and returned:
```
Result: 0
```

---

## User
Working with Day1.GetPassword. Create variables to represent the current position of a cursor in an array of integers from 0 to 99

## Assistant
Added variables to `Day1.cs`:
- `numbers` - array of integers 0-99
- `position` - cursor position initialized to 0

---

## User
Change the initial value to be 50

## Assistant
Done. `position` now starts at 50.

---

## User
Add a helper function that will move the position a given number of places left or right. If reaching the beginning or end of the array the position should loop around. So left one place from 0 would move to position 99 and right one position from 99 should point to 0.

## Assistant
Added `Move` helper function that:
- Takes `position` and `delta` (positive = right, negative = left)
- Wraps around using modulo 100
- Handles negative wraparound (e.g., position 0 left 1 → 99)

---

## User
The inputLines variable will contain a set of instructions. Each instruction starts with L or R indicating whether to move the position left or right, followed by a number for the number of places to move. E.g. L10 means move left 10, R5 means move right 5. Loop through the input lines updating the position.

## Assistant
Added loop that processes each instruction:
- Parses direction (`L` or `R`) from first character
- Parses amount from remaining characters
- Calculates delta (negative for left, positive for right)
- Updates position using `Move`

---

## User
Within the loop, any time the position is 0 increment and counter. This should be returned from the GetPassword function.

## Assistant
Done. Added:
- `counter` variable initialized to 0
- Increments when `position == 0` after each move
- Returns `counter` from the function

---

## User
Create a new function similar to GetNumberOfTimesStoppingOnZero called GetNumberOfTimesPassingZero. This one should increment the counter each time the zero position is stopped on or passed in the changes of position.

## Assistant
Added `GetNumberOfTimesPassingZero` function with a helper `CountZeroCrossings` that calculates:

- **Moving right** (delta > 0): counts how many times we wrap from 99→0: `(position + delta) / 100`
- **Moving left** (delta < 0): counts how many times we reach or pass through 0: `(amount - position) / 100 + 1` if `amount >= position`, else `0`

---

## User
Add a unit test to AdventOfCode.Year2025.Tests.Day1Tests verifying that GetNumberOfTimesPassingZero returns 6 for the existing test input

## Assistant
The test initially failed - the function returned 8, not 6. After investigation, the issue was when starting at position 0 and moving left - we shouldn't count the starting position as "passing through".

Fixed `CountZeroCrossings` to handle the edge case when `position == 0`:
```csharp
if (position == 0)
{
    return amount / 100;
}
```

Both tests now pass:
```
Passed!  - Failed:     0, Passed:     2, Skipped:     0, Total:     2
```

---

## User
Update AdventOfCodeRunner Program.cs to add a selection and processing for the 25-1b task and call GetNumberOfTimesPassingZero when selected.

## Assistant
Done. Updated `Program.cs` with:

1. **Menu items** (lines 60-61):
   ```
   > '25-1a' - 2025 Day 1 (TBC), Part 1
   > '25-1b' - 2025 Day 1 (TBC), Part 2
   ```

2. **Switch case** (lines 332-337):
   ```csharp
   case "25-1b":
       {
           var result = AdventOfCode.Year2025.Day1.GetNumberOfTimesPassingZero(GetInputDataLines(2025, 1));
           Console.WriteLine($"Result: {result}");
       }
       break;
   ```

Build succeeded.
